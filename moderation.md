### Scope

These guidelines apply to all Decred comm platforms. Chat rooms require more quick and strict measures because many rooms are used to coordinate work.

### For everyone

Unproductive behavior may trigger a warning, followed by a ban.

Signs of an unproductive behavior:

- persistent cross posting, refusing to read any resources
- comments that suggest a substantial lack of understanding
- lack of a demonstrable point
- constant concern trolling
- persistent attempts to get exposure for another project, even disguised as legit criticism
- word salads

Spam may get removed and trigger a ban without warning.

### For moderators

- as early in the unproductive interaction as possible, give a clear warning before the ban to set proper expectations for all
- when the removed content is not outright junk/spam but is instead heated and "controversial", try to save it before removal so that it is later possible to verify mod actions _and_ analyze behavior of bad actors
  - on Reddit, snapshot the content via [archive.today](https://archive.today/) or [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/) before removal
    - if it is in the blocked state, allow it temporarily, snapshot, and quickly remove again
    - alternatively, snapshot it from the user's profile page where it is shown even when when it's blocked in the subreddit (this only works for comments)
    - use old.reddit.com for snapshots since the new style hides most content when javascript is disabled
  - on Matrix, save the conversation in a text file

### For Decred community members

- if provacateurs are giving us shit on platform X, do not invite them to platform Y (i.e. do not invite the crazy person to the office)
