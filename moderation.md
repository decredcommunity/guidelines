### Scope

These guidelines apply to all Decred comm platforms. Chat rooms require more quick and strict measures because many rooms are used to coordinate work.

### For everyone

Unproductive behavior may trigger a warning, followed by a ban.

Signs of an unproductive behavior:

- persistent cross posting, refusing to read any resources
- comments that suggest a substantial lack of understanding
- lack of a demonstrable point
- constant concern trolling
- persistent attempts to get exposure for another project
- word salads

Spam may get removed and trigger a ban without warning.

### For moderators

- as early in the unproductive interaction as possible, give a clear warning before the ban to set proper expectations for all

### For Decred community members

- if provacateurs are giving us shit on platform X, do not invite them to platform Y (i.e. do not invite the crazy person to the office)
