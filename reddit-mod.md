Moderation queue shows posts and comments that were reported by users or automatically flagged by Reddit. Check it couple times a day.

This is simply all published posts newest first. Some spam bypasses all filters and gets published. Sorting by 'new' allows to quickly notice it on top.

Log of all mod activity. Check it to catch and undo any false positives by the AutoModerator, or simply see what happened while you were away.

## Tips

Typical mod run:

* check modqueue for new things to process, keep it clean
* check new posts, remove spam that bypassed all filters
* check modlog for AutoModerator false positives
* check comments for spam

Avoid content removal as much as possible. Be ready to publicly comment on every case of removal.

If you see an important or controversial discussion that has the risk of being deleted, save the `old.reddit.com` version of the page to [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) or [archive.today](https://archive.today) (there are browser extensions to do it quickly). We had few incidents when thoughtful discussion was delisted from r/decred by the submitter removing his post. The counter-measure after such "attention attack" is to submit the link to deleted thread to r/decred.

Add known users to friends by pressing `+friends` on their user page. This allows to quickly see their comments. Then you can also follow their content across all subreddits at https://www.reddit.com/r/friends/

If you see a new request in Reddit Moderator Mail (modmail), try to answer it or ask other mods or marketing people.

When in doubt, ask other mods.
